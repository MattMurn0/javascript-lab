		"description": "This is a project that I had started a while ago on my Linux virtual machine. I wanted to learn how to code Javascript and React, however I didn't spend enough time learning the basics, and my lack of project experience led me to fall short of finishing. I hope that with the skills I learn in Web Application Development, I could finish this project, and make the webpage I was picturing instead of what it turned out to be."
